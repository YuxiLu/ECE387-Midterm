# Introduction
The Maxim DS18B20 is a low-cost temperature measurement sensor. This device digitally reports temperature in degrees C with 9 to 12-bit precision, -55C to 125C (+/-0.5C). Each sensor has a unique 64-Bit Serial number etched into it, allowing for a large number of sensors to be used on one data bus. This sensitive and versatile part is the cornerstone of many data-logging and temperature control projects.

# Digital Temperature Sensor
The DS18B20 temperature sensor is a 3-pin electronic component (like a simple transistor) from Maxim (formerly Dallas) which uses 1-wire protocol to communicate with master device (microprocessor or microcontroller).
